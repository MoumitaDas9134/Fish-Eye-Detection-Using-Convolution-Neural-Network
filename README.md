Fish Freshness Detection using CNN
This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify fish images as **Fresh** or **Non-Fresh**, helping automate quality inspection in fish markets, seafood industries, and packaging systems.
🔍 Features

- 🧠 Custom CNN architecture built with Keras
- 📊 Saves training metrics, evaluation reports, and confusion matrix
- 🗂️ Automatically classifies unseen images into **FRESH** or **NON_FRESH**
- 📦 Clean, modular code (easy to modify or extend)
